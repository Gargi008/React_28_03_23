//React a JS library


/* browser --> server 
html css js 

we had to accomodate JS to work with different browsers

//jQuery - th syntax works across all the browsers

//backbone.js  - organising files


//ajax - we started focusing on JS rather than HTML
//ajax - our apps r like desktop apps and JS updates the DOM 

SPA - Single page applications 


2010 - Angular  - Google --- large containers to wrap our project

MVC - model view control 


it became very complex to find bugs 


2013 facebook came up with React 
React developed a whole new way of building apps.

// Imparative vs . Declarative

// In imperative paradigm we directly change indivisual patts of our app 
// in response to various user events 


// It takes a lot of time for DOM chnages to happen




//1. Declarative approach  

/* let State= {
    user: 'Gargi',
    isLoggedIn: true,
} */


//React asks how ur app should look like,

//I ll make the chnages for u 

//2. Build websites with reusable components ( JS function)

/* function Hello(){
    return <h1>Helloooo </h1>
}
 */
/* class Hello extends React.component{
    render(){
       return <h1>Helloooo </h1>
}
      
    }
}
 */

/* 3. unidirectional data flow */


//4. UI Library 
/* React 
ReactDOM */
